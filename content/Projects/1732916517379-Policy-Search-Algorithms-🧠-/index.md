Fine Tuning the Algorithm
{{< /badge >}}


 Find an optimal policy for an agent to follow in order to maximize its cumulative reward.
-  This method involves searching through a space of possible policies, which are mappings from states to actions, in order to find the policy that yields the highest expected reward
- Like <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Gradient Descent</mark> and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Evolutionary Algorithm</mark>s

> Class of optimization algorithms inspired by the natural selection and evolution. 
> They mimic the process of natural selection, reproduction and mutation

## Types of Evolutionary Algos 
 1.<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> Genetic Algorithms (GA)</mark>: These algorithms use a population of candidate solutions, which are represented as strings of symbols, and apply genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve the population towards better solutions.
>     
> 2. <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Evolution Strategies (ES)</mark>: ES algorithms optimize a population of candidate solutions by perturbing the current solutions with random noise and selecting the best-performing individuals for the next generation.
>     
> 3. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Genetic Programming (GP)</mark>: GP algorithms evolve computer programs or mathematical expressions to solve problems by using genetic operators to create and modify the structure of the programs.
>     
> 4. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Differential Evolution (DE</mark>): DE algorithms optimize a population of candidate solutions by using the difference between individuals in the population to guide the search towards better solutions.
