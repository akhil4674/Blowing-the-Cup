    >}}

	+ Increased transistor density.
	+ Elevated power consumption and heat dissipation in ICs.
* **Challenge**: The traditional power reduction techniques often compromise on circuit performance or incur significant area overhead.
* **Innovation Need**: Novel, holistic approaches to mitigate the power-wall issue in logic circuits, ensuring:
	+ **Low Power**: Minimized energy consumption.
	+ **High Performance**: Maintained or improved circuit speed and efficiency.
	+ **Compact Design**: Reduced area overhead.

## 💡 Proposed Solution: Device Stacking
-----------------------------------------

### Concept 📦
* Vertically stacking transistors or circuit components.
