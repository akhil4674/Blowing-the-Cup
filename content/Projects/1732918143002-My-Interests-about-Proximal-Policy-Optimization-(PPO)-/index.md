## My research about it 
This code implements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm using TensorFlow and NumPy. PPO is a reinforcement learning algorithm used to train agents to make decisions in an environment.

**Important Classes:**

1. **`PolicyNetwork`**: This class defines the neural network architecture used by the agent to decide which action to take given a state. It consists of two dense layers with ReLU activation and an output layer with softmax activation to produce action probabilities.
2. **`PPO`**: This class implements the core logic of the PPO algorithm. It handles action selection, training the policy network, and updating the agent's behavior.


**Important Functions:**

1. **`PolicyNetwork.__init__`**: Initializes the policy network with its layers.
2. **`PolicyNetwork.call`**: Defines the forward pass of the network, taking a state as input and returning action probabilities.
3. **`PPO.__init__`**: Initializes the PPO algorithm with hyperparameters like learning rate, clip ratio, and coefficients for value and entropy.
4. **`PPO.get_action`**: Uses the policy network to select an action based on the current state.
5. **`PPO.train`**: Updates the policy network's weights based on collected experience (states, actions, advantages, returns, and old action probabilities) using gradient descent and the PPO objective function. This function is the core of the training process.
