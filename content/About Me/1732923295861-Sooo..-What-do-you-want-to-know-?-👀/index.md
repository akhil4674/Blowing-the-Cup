<ul>
<li>I’m working with semiconductor Manufacturing Tools with focus in MEMS and SiC technology. I currently work at Bosch Semiconductor WaferFab,🤖 where I deal with monitoring and building processes strategies for CVD, PECVD, and SACVD tools from AMAT. These tools are  important for producing MEMS gyroscopes and accelerometers. I’ve got a deep understanding of how these processes work, how the tools works, and the whole workflow in a wafer fab.

  <li>
At  Bosch Semiconductor Plant, whee I use the Data Analytics to monitor and control the Manufacturing Processes bringing the production quality till 3 sigma Value using Optimization Methods</li>

<ul>
<li>For almost past one year I have with working with Prof. Gerhard Neumann , First at FZI Forschungszentrum Informatik , where my focus was on developing and working with algorithms for Animal robot (Spot by Boston Dynamics)  which required correcting and reasoning the behaviour of the robots control arm and positions Based on Machine learning Algorithms.

  </li>
  <li>
There I learned ROS Robot Operating System , and also focused on developing GUI page for the robot control</li>
